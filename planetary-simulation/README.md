# Planetary Simulation

This project is a planetary simulation that visualizes the movements of planets in a gravitational system. It uses the VPython library to create a 3D representation of the planets and their orbits.

## Project Structure

- `src/simulation.py`: Contains the main logic of the planetary simulation. It defines classes for planets and their movements, as well as functions to calculate gravitational forces and update the positions of the planets.
  
- `main.py`: The entry point of the application. It imports the simulation from `src/simulation.py` and starts the visualization of the planetary movements.

## Requirements

To run this simulation, you need to have Python installed along with the VPython library. You can install VPython using pip:

```
pip install vpython
```

## Running the Simulation

To execute the simulation, run the `main.py` file:

```
python main.py
```

This will launch a window displaying the planetary simulation, where you can observe the movements of the planets in real-time.
